## Configuration

Before using the `CodeGPTNode` with ComfyUI, ensure you have an account with CodeGPT (https://codegpt.co/) and have set up a custom agent to use with the plugin. This is necessary to obtain the API key, organization ID, and agent ID required for the script to function.

### Setting up CodeGPT

1. Sign up for an account at https://codegpt.co/.
2. Create a new agent within your CodeGPT account dashboard.
3. Note down the API key, organization ID, and agent ID provided after creating the agent.

### Configuring ComfyUI

To integrate the `CodeGPTNode` into your ComfyUI workflow:

1. Add the `CodeGPTNode` to your workflow within ComfyUI.
2. Configure the node by entering the API key, organization ID, and agent ID into the designated fields in the node's settings.
3. Save the configuration to securely store your credentials within ComfyUI.

The output from the `CodeGPTNode` will be a text prompt that you can pass into the image generation process as part of your workflow.
